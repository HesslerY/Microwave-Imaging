This is my repository of codes for microwave imaging. Currently, it only contains a Quadratic Programming approach. But I intend to develop new methodologies and make them available here.  

* The files with results of experiments with breast phantoms were not uploaded since they are +100 MB .mat files (GitHub restrictions). So you must run the code in order to check them. Or you can e-mail me.  
* You must install Gurobi Optimizer in order to run the algorithm.  

More information will be provided later.
